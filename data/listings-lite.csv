Surrounded with restaurants, terraces and shops this is one if the best locations in the city, because it’s in the middle of where all happens yet in a quiet street. In my house I offer two double bed & coffee rooms each with a private shower and one room even with a bath. I live in the building and I have my own bathroom. A bed & coffee room means your rent a b&b room, but instead of breakfast with unlimited coffee and tea that you make with your own Nespresso maker. The building offers a pretty unique large roof terrace that is magically lit by night. 

I'm a foody and spend much of my time cooking, going to the local markets and enjoy restaurants. If you need some advise where to go or what to eat please ask!

In my home I offer my guests privacy. But please knock my door for questions or a chat any time and most likely we’ll meet on the terrace anyway ;)

Enjoying a city like Amsterdam is all about having a place where you feel comfortable and safe at home in a strange environment. And especially to have a good bed, a warm shower and a nice cup of coffee or tea with a stroopwafel at any time you like. In my travels I visit and visited a lot of B&B's globally. Staying in a room in somebody’s home often felt I was staying with friends. Some of them became and still are dear friends after many years. This experience is what I try to offer my guests. Live like a local, feel at home. Tot ziens in Amsterdam, Marcel.

B&B Lisenced by council of Amsterdam.

But because of kids coming the ship became too small for 2 kids, so we started to realise an ark, this took about 1,5 year.

It feels like a private lake just in front of our door. When the sun comes out our garden-side balcony is the perfect place for a morning breakfast and coffee. And in the afternoon we often enjoy a glass of wine on our French balcony on the other side of the apartment, watching many boats come by on the canal. 
Last summer we discovered the Amsterdam canals with our own private boat. Being near the water or on the water is one of the most relaxing things you can do in this city (there’s a boat rental nearby if you would like to try).  We also enjoy cooking and dining at home or somewhere else in the city.

A single Norwegian living in Amsterdam, I have a steady job and my own apartment with a guest room. I like hosting guests from all over the world, and have done so lots in the last few years. I'm a huge nerd who loves science and science fiction, and am very curious about the world around me. I like learning new things, making new friends and generally try to experience as much as I can. 

INTERESTS
I go to a gym, train kendo, do archery and pistol shooting. I like to go to concerts (all kinds of music), to cinemas (all kinds of movies), to play games (like chess or backgammon or poker, also more advanced board games), and to read books (all kinds, but sci-fi a big favorite). 

FAVORITE BOOKS
I read mostly sci-fi, fantasy and crime books, and a fair amount of non-fiction too, mostly science and atheism.

Small list of favorite fiction writers: William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, Iain M Banks, Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman, J. R. R. Tolkien, Alan Moore, Peter F. Hamilton, Tibor Fischer, James Ellroy, China Miéville, Moebius, Andrew Vachss, Nick Harkaway, Charles Stross, David Brin, Harry Turtledove, Ian McDonald, Patrick Rothfuss, Cory Doctorow, Tibor Fischer, Kim Stanley Robinson

Favorite non-fiction: Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins, Stephen Hawking, Carl Sagan. 

MOVIES
I love going to the cinema, and I love cinema from all over the world, with a special place in my heart for Japanese and Chinese films.

MUSIC
I love all kinds of music, but especially world (ethnic), metal and rock. Weak spot for singer/songerwriters, especially female ones.
